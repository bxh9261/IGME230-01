# Sea Sharp

## Concept

Sea Sharp, a game that will make you C# Sharp!

## Genre

Sea Sharp is a puzzle game similar to the style of Flexbox froggy.

## Platform

Desktop preferred, mobile friendly. 

## Story

Carpy the Carp needs your help! He and his friends need you to use your knowledge of C# to avoid the hooks and stay safe!

## Aesthetics

Graphics style - Cartoonish, childish

Sound - Something fun and bubbly, whatever the youthful fish listen to nowadays. Additional blub blub noises here and there.

## Gameplay

### Here are some of the different topics:

1. Variables
⋅⋅1. ints- for spawning a specific number of fish
⋅⋅2. bools- for checking whether or not there's a hook
⋅⋅3. strings- give Carpy a name
2. Statements
⋅⋅1. switch statements- more complicated puzzles may have different methods to call based on number of hooks present
⋅⋅2. if statements- writing statements along the lines of "if a hook does not exist in this area, spawn fish"
3. Methods

Fish are controlled purely through code entered on the left side of the screen, and a button or pressing "enter" to render

## Screenshots

Coming soon!

## Other

I will need to figure out how to incorporate and compile C# code into the game, or I could potentially cheat it a little by checking for specific strings. For example if the challenge is to create an if statement like "if(!containsHook){fish.Spawn();}" I could check specifically for that, though it would eliminate the possiblity of users coming up with solutions that work that I didn't think of.
